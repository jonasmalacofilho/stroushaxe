StrousHaxe
==========

This is an attempt to develop a comprehensive tutorial for Haxe by following the structure of Bjarne Stroustrup's book: ** Programming ** - Principles and Practice Using C++ (or more simply, PPPUC++).

According to the author, that book is about programming, where C++ is used as a tool to teach it.
He recommends C++ because:

 - It is one of the most widely used programming languages, found in unsurpassed range of application areas.
 - C++ is precisely and comprehensively defined by a non-proprietary international standard.
 - Quality and/or free implementations are available on every kind of computer.
 - Most of the programming concepts you learn using C++ can be used directly in other languages, such as C, C#, Fortran and Java.
 - C++ directly supports the key concepts and techniques used in real world software.
 - Finally, he simply likes C++ as a language for writing elegant and efficient code.

While the first two reasons do not yet apply to Haxe, the last three certainly do (the last one being that 'We do like Haxe for writing elegant and efficient code'); the third reason somewhat already does apply as well.

In fact, we think of this as part of a large effort by a lot of people so that all the six reasons may soon be true.

Haxe is very powerful and fits an important gap in the language ecosystem.
We think one can be very productive, elegant and efficient by learning Haxe as a first programming language.

Stroustup's work is great and PPPUC++ is an excellent introductory book on programming in general.
Since we think he has done it far better than we could, adapting it to Haxe (some sort of PPPUHaxe) seems an interesting experiment both for teaching Haxe and programming.

--------------------------

At this point, this is just a conversion of the introductory examples from C++ to Haxe.
So, for one to follow these examples, one must have PPPUC++ and learn some of both languages.
Keeping the Haxe manual close by might be useful too.

If you know Haxe, you can help us by converting more examples from the book and by writing replacement explanations.

If you don't yet know Haxe, you can write the ideas that each example conveys (from PPPUC++).

Please note, however, that as things move forward the maintainers may take a completely different approach.
At the same time, if you do cooperate, we guarantee you recognition and that your input will be taken into account.

We don't want – and will reject – transcriptions of Stroustrup's book.
If this initiative grows in the direction that we believe it can and becomes fully integrated with the original book, we will then seek permission from the copyright owners to somehow produce it as a single text.
Also, if by integrating with PPPC++ it becomes necessary to sell the resulting text, the maintainers of this project guarantee that any and all direct profits attributed to this initiative shall be redirected to public and verifiable Haxe advancements.
