StrousHaxe
==========

This is an attempt to develop (a meaningful) tutorial for Haxe by following the structure of Bjarne Stroustrup's book ** Programming ** - Principles and Practice Using C++ (simply PPPUC++).

(According to the author) The book is about programming, where C++ is a tool used to teach programming. 
He recommends C++ because C++:
- is one of the most widely used programming languages, found in unsurpassed range of application areas
- C++ is precisely and comprehensively defined by a non-proprietary international standard
- Quality and/or free implementations are available on every kind of computer
- Most of the programming concepts you learn using C++ can be used directly in other languages, such as C, C#, Fortran and Java.
- directly supports the key concepts and techniques  used in real world software  
- Finally, he simply likes C++ as a language for writing elegant and efficient code.

While the first two reasons do not apply to Haxe yet, the third applies somehow, the last three certainly do (the last one, being that 'We do like Haxe for writing elegant and efficient code').

So this is also part of large efforts being done by a lot of people for that all the six reasons may be true.

Haxe is powerful and fits an important gap in the language market, one can be very productive and elegant and efficient by learning Haxe as a first programming language.

Why StrousHaxe?
---------------

Because Stroustup's work is amazing and PPPUC++ is an excellent book. We don't want to redo what he has done because he has done better than what we could, so adapt it to become PPPUHaxe seems a clever idea.

Want help or want to help?
--------------------------

At this point, it is just a conversion of the examples used in C++ to Haxe from the introduction Chapters.

So for one to follow, one must have PPPUC++ and learn both languages.

If you know Haxe you can help, by adding more converted examples from the book writing text replacements that would transform it in a "PPPUHaxe"

If you don't know Haxe yet, you can write the ideas that each example conveys (after PPPUC++).

As things move forward, we may take a completely different approach.

We don't want (and we will reject) transcriptions of the book, if this initiative grows in the direction that we believe it can become a fully integrated text with that book, we shall then seek permission to the copyright owner of that book and worry about legally producing it as one text (or writing something similar completely from scratch that in a way that it does not infringe copyrights).

If for legally producing an integration with that book it becomes necessary to sell the resulting text (as the C++PPP is), the maintainer of this project guarantees that any and all direct profits attributed to this initiative  shall be redirected to public and verifiable Haxe advancement.

If you cooperate, the maintainer of the project guarantees you recognition and that your input will be taken in the process.
