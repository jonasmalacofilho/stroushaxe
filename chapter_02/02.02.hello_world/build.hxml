# `*.hxml` files are one of the ways of passing parameters to the Haxe compiler;
# in them, you can use any of the compiler command line options

# start at the HelloWorld class;
# Haxe will always search for it in a module with the same name
-main HelloWorld

# compile it for the Haxe interpreter and imediatly run it there
--interp

# to compile and run this, execute from the command line
#   haxe <path to build.hxml>
# example
#   haxe build.hmxl
